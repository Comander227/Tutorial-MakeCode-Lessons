#MakeCode Tutorial Lessons Launch Pad


##Chase The Balloons Tile Map Extension

[Chase the Balloons]
(https://arcade.makecode.com/#tutorial:97796-08116-35806-19960)

This tutorial is an expansion on the [Chase the Pizza](https://arcade.makecode.com/#tutorial:/tutorials/chase-the-pizza) tutorial by MakeCode Arcade. This guide expands on the initial concept and adds a tile map to create a more controlled spawning system as well as a larger map for the player to explore. At the end you will have a chance to modify or create your own tile map for your game. 

###Tile Map Example
[Lake Lougai Maze](https://arcade.makecode.com/S35698-43061-58432-30968) 

Using the concepts shown in the previous tutorial you can make a similar maze game to this example using original tile maps and sprites. 




##Shark Attack Extension 
[Feeding Frenzy Extension]
(https://arcade.makecode.com/#tutorial:67095-52275-80214-36662)

This is a tutorial meant to serve as an extension on [MakeCode Arcade’s Shark Attack Skillmap](https://arcade.makecode.com/--skillmap#shark). _Be sure to check that one out first so you have more context for the extension._  

In this tutorial you will expand Shark Attack game by adding enemy subs, projectiles, and power-ups. Be sure to see how functions and the timer are use to extend the gameplay. 

(Note that it does use the default code from the end of the Shark Attack Skillmap, so if you made original changes to that game the you will need to recreate those upon the completion of this tutorial.)



##Downhill Ski Tutorial

[Downhill Ski Tutorial]
(https://arcade.makecode.com/#tutorial:51992-12898-43218-12178)

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a scrolling arcade style game with the theme of skiing. This game uses various sprite kinds to create positive and negative items for the player to avoid or pick up. Keep in mind how the speed mechanic is coded as it can be used in various ways to create specific outcomes or alterations to a game. 


##Pong

[Pong Tutorial]
(https://arcade.makecode.com/#tutorial:68525-32956-97103-19855)

Use this tutorial to create a version of the classic arcade game Pong. This version has a single player and two player mode so you can play against your friends. 



##Arcade Style Space Shooter

[Mr Wender’s Space Shooter] 
(https://arcade.makecode.com/S95543-44824-80543-00012)

This is a project that I have been developing. It uses concepts that are touched upon in the Shark Attack Extension, the Downhill Ski Tutorial, and [MakeCode Arcade's Space Adventure Skillmap](https://arcade.makecode.com/--skillmap#space). I even went further and developed a boss fight for the end of the game. This boss fight took a long time to develop and I referred to various videos from the [MakeCode Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MicrosoftMakeCode) to figure out exactly how to code it. Feel free to explore my game and use some of the concepts to create your own original game.
